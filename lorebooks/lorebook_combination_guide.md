# Lorebook Combination Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the process of combining multiple lorebooks to create complex, multi-faceted scenarios. By layering different environmental and situational factors, we can create rich, nuanced contexts for our personas to operate within.

## Combination Process

1. **Select Base Lorebook**: Choose a primary lorebook that represents the main environment or situation.
2. **Add Modifying Lorebooks**: Layer additional lorebooks to add complexity and nuance.
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: Use the conflict resolution rules to address any contradictions.
4. **Apply Cumulative Effects**: Combine and amplify shared elements across lorebooks.
5. **Adjust Priorities**: Recalibrate behavior and communication priorities based on the combined scenario.

## Conflict Resolution Rules

When combining lorebooks, conflicts may arise. Use these rules to resolve contradictions:

1. **Severity Principle**: The more severe or extreme condition takes precedence.
2. **Recency Rule**: For time-based conflicts, the most recent condition is prioritized.
3. **Specificity Override**: More specific conditions override general ones.
4. **Cumulative Impact**: Where possible, combine impacts for a more extreme effect.
5. **Contextual Relevance**: Prioritize elements most relevant to the specific scenario.

## Cumulative Effects

Identify shared elements across lorebooks and amplify their effects:

- **Risk Factors**: Combine and intensify shared risks.
- **Resource Scarcity**: Multiply the scarcity effect for overlapping resource limitations.
- **Social Dynamics**: Intensify social changes that are present in multiple lorebooks.
- **Communication Challenges**: Stack communication difficulties for a more complex landscape.

## Priority Adjustment Process

1. **Identify Overlapping Priorities**: List priorities that appear in multiple lorebooks.
2. **Calculate Cumulative Scores**: Sum the priority scores across all relevant lorebooks.
3. **Normalize Scores**: Adjust the combined scores to fit within the -5 to +5 range.
4. **Resolve Conflicts**: For conflicting priorities, use the conflict resolution rules.
5. **Introduce New Priorities**: Add unique priorities from each lorebook, adjusting scores as needed.

## Example Combinations

### Urban Center + Economic Crisis + Technological Disruption

```yaml
Environment: Urban Center
Primary Crisis: Economic Crisis
Secondary Crisis: Technological Disruption

Key Aspects:
  Infrastructure:
    Power_Grid: Unreliable due to economic and tech issues
    Internet: Severely compromised, affecting both work and daily life
    Public_Services: Strained by economic crisis, exacerbated by tech failures

  Social_Dynamics:
    Community_Cohesion: Increased physical interaction due to tech disruption
    Economic_Pressure: Extreme, with tech disruption limiting recovery options
    Information_Flow: Severely disrupted, causing increased anxiety and misinformation

  Resource_Availability:
    Digital_Services: Largely unavailable, forcing adaptation
    Financial_Services: Severely limited by both economic and tech crises
    Job_Market: Extremely competitive, with tech sector in chaos

Priority_Adjustments:
  Adaptability: +5
  Financial_Security: +5
  Offline_Skill_Development: +4
  Community_Networking: +3
  Digital_Dependency: -5
```

### Conflict Zone + Natural Disaster

```yaml
Environment: Conflict Zone
Primary Crisis: Active Conflict
Secondary Crisis: Natural Disaster

Key Aspects:
  Physical_Security:
    Threat_Level: Extreme, compounded by natural disaster
    Safe_Zones: Severely limited, further reduced by disaster impact
    Emergency_Services: Almost non-existent due to conflict, overwhelmed by disaster

  Resource_Scarcity:
    Basic_Necessities: Critical shortage, exacerbated by disaster
    Medical_Supplies: Extreme scarcity, high demand from both crises
    Shelter: Severe shortage due to conflict damage and disaster destruction

  Social_Dynamics:
    Community_Cohesion: Potential for increased solidarity in face of dual crises
    Faction_Tensions: May be temporarily reduced due to shared disaster experience
    External_Aid: Extremely challenging to receive and distribute

Priority_Adjustments:
  Immediate_Survival: +5
  Conflict_Avoidance: +4
  Resource_Acquisition: +5
  Long-term_Planning: -4
  Faction_Loyalty: -2 (temporarily)
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Lorebooks**: Carefully read through each lorebook to be combined.
2. **Create Combination Matrix**: List key elements from each lorebook side by side.
3. **Apply Conflict Resolution**: Use the rules to resolve any contradictions.
4. **Synthesize Narratives**: Craft a coherent narrative that incorporates elements from all lorebooks.
5. **Adjust Persona Guidelines**: Modify persona behavior and priority guidelines based on the combined scenario.
6. **Develop Unique Aspects**: Create new elements that emerge from the interaction of multiple lorebooks.
7. **Playtest and Refine**: Test the combined scenario with different personas and refine as needed.

By following this guide, you can create rich, multi-layered scenarios that provide deep and nuanced contexts for persona interactions and storytelling.
