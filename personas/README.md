# Enhanced Persona Profiles

This directory contains detailed persona profiles for information operations analysis. Each persona is defined in its own file with a consistent structure.

## Structure
Each persona profile includes:
- **Core Identity**: Basic demographic and background information
- **Psychographic Indicators**: Values, attitudes, interests, and lifestyle factors
- **Communication Patterns**: Preferred channels, language style, and engagement habits
- **Sentiment Baseline**: Default emotional states and typical reactions
- **Influence Factors**: Key elements that shape opinions and behaviors
- **Response Triggers**: Events or messages likely to provoke strong reactions

## Usage
These personas can be:
1. Used independently for basic analysis
2. Combined with lorebooks for contextual modification
3. Applied to specific scenarios or events
4. Used to model group dynamics and interactions
